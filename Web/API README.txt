so far we are able to send requests to the api and receive the different
responses for leaderboard entries.

API Links for sending requests:
/api/TopTimesTodayEntries **
/api/TopTimesAllTimeEntries
/api/TopScoresTodayEntries **
/api/TopScoresAllTimeEntries
none currently have limits on how many entries they can hold.

**these aren't fully setup for sorting and holding only top ? amount of entries yet
